Additional IP Rights Grant (Patents)

"Works" means the code distributed by Waymo LLC (“Waymo”) at
https://github.com/waymo-research/waymo-open-dataset/third_party/camera.
U.S. Pat. No. 10,939,057. Patent Pending: U.S. Patent App No. 17/105,141

Waymo hereby grants to you a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, personal
patent license to make, have made, use, import, and otherwise transfer the
Works, where such license applies only to those patent claims, both currently
owned by Waymo and acquired in the future, licensable by Waymo that are
necessarily infringed by the Works when you use the Works to process data
from the Waymo Open Dataset (available at https://waymo.com/open) as
authorized by and in compliance with the Waymo Dataset License Agreement for
Non-Commercial Use. This grant does not include claims that would be
infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the Works. If you
or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or order or agree to the
institution of patent litigation or any other patent enforcement activity
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that the Works or any code incorporated within the Works constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of patent
infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this license for
the Works shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
